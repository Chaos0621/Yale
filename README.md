# Participant and Silver Medalist (Top 5%), Kaggle Competition: Yale/UNC-CH - Geophysical Waveform Inversion (Team Leader),
[Online] | [June 2025]
•	Developed a hybrid physics-guided machine learning pipeline to estimate subsurface properties (e.g., velocity maps) from noisy seismic waveform data using Full Waveform Inversion (FWI).
•	Trained CAFormer (backbones: b36, m36) and ConvNeXt V2 (backbones: huge, large, base) models on OpenFWI datasets; implemented stacking ensemble for validation and median inference for testing.
•	I was primarily responsible for developing the overall task plan and determining the model architecture. In addition, I organized the weekly competition discussions and led the subsequent solution optimization steps.
